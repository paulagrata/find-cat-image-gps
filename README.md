## Geotag Image Viewer

## description:
Build a URL shortener application, something similar to https://bit.ly.<br>
The interface should allow you to input a url and display the shortened version after the user submits it.<br>
Implement the URL shortener API with two main functions:
1. one which shortens the URL into a brief alphanumeric string.
2. one which expands the string into the original URL. If no such URL exists, it should return an error.
<br><br>
The project should contain a data storage method, and you should be prepared to talk about the
advantages and limitations of your chosen method and schema. Additionally, the project should
utilize dependencies such that you could share this with your interviewer and they would be able
to run it without additional system configuration. Be prepared to demo a working version of the
project.
